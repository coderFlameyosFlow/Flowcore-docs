# Flowcore
**A rewritten version of EssentialsX designed for speed, features and customizability**

NOTE: Although this works for everything, this was designed for community/public servers.

Just looking at this, your mind will get full of questions, one of them may include: (QNA)
1. Why rewrite EssentialsX?

   **DUE to the lack of features and quality essentialsx may give you**
2. What's wrong with EssentialsX?

   **EssentialsX is horribly slow, and less feature-rich than Flowcore, and more bloated in terms of commands**
   **EssentialsX was a good idea, don't get me wrong, but it was horribly designed.**
3. so what features do you plan to fix and/or add?

   **It includes, but not limited to: **
   
   - Adding proper databases like MySQL, H2, etc. 
   - Asynchronous teleportation plugin-side (without the need of Paper).
   - Similar API with no costs
   - Significant-optimizations to Micro-optimizations to performance
   - Ability to use a bunch of commands proxy-wide instead of server-wide
   - ACTUALLY deal with heavy tasks asynchronously
   - Using a more optimized logging library called [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/)
   - Ability to open GUIs like cartography tables and anvils without the need of Paper
